# [Images-Searcher](https://searchimagesplease.surge.sh)
A place to search for images that I can use in my powerpoint presentations, and other designs, from free and creditable sources and their APIs. 

# Why
This could be said as my first attempt at making a functional react Website. While there have been others, this is one that I think has some use. It saves me time by not having to go to the websites whose API's im grabbing for the images. Now there still are a whole tonne of other things that could be done to improve this thing, but the Focus here is more on the learning process rather than development and Production. 

# Installation for Playing Around
1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies with node. 
3. Mess around. 
4. Or just head over to [The deployed website](https://searchimagesplease.surge.sh)

# Credits
The Credits to this whole thing must go to the dude whose course I am watching to learn react from. [This is their Github Repo](https://github.com/OakAcademy). Excellent teacher. His courses are definitely recommended. Huge Thanks!
